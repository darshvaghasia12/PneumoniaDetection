  <h1>Pneumonia Detection Project Using VGG16 and VGG19</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This project aims to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using two popular convolutional neural network architectures: VGG16 and VGG19.</p>

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <h3>1. Data Collection and Preprocessing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The dataset consists of chest X-ray images categorized into two classes: normal and pneumonia.</li>
    <li>Data preprocessing involves resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Model Architecture</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Two pre-trained convolutional neural network architectures, VGG16 and VGG19, are used as the backbone for feature extraction.</li>
    <li>The last few layers of the networks are replaced with custom fully connected layers for binary classification (normal vs. pneumonia).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Model Training and Evaluation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset using transfer learning techniques.</li>
    <li>Training metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are monitored to assess model performance.</li>
    <li>The trained models are evaluated on a separate test set to measure their ability to generalize to unseen data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone the Repository
      <pre>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pneumonia-detection.git
cd pneumonia-detection</pre></li>
    <li>Install Dependencies
      <pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre></li>
    <li>Data Preparation
      <ul>
        <li>Download the chest X-ray dataset and organize it into appropriate directories (e.g., train/normal, train/pneumonia, test/normal, test/pneumonia).</li>
        <li>Ensure proper preprocessing steps such as resizing and normalization are applied to the images.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Model Training
      <pre>python train.py --model VGG16 --epochs 20</pre></li>
    <li>Model Evaluation
      <pre>python evaluate.py --model_path models/VGG16_best_model.pth --test_dir test</pre></li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>The performance of the VGG16 and VGG19 models is compared based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Model performance on pneumonia detection is visualized using confusion matrices and ROC curves.</p>
